Visual Animations of Sorting Algorithms and Dijkstra's Algorithm  

To compile and run sorting algorithms...  
`cd ./sorting  
make  
sort`  

To compile and run Dijkstra's algorithm...  
`cd ./dijkstra
make
dijkstra`  

*Note*  
These programs must be run on Linux, and local computer must have OpenGL directories installed.  

*Controls for Dijkstra's Algorithm*  
Right-click on grid to set start point. Right-click again to set end point.   
Left-click to create walls. Hold left-click to draw lines of walls.  
Press 'D' to run Dijkstra's Algorithm! Press 'R' to reset points. Press 'P' to toggle path.
