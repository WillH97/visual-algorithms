Visual Animations of Sorting Algorithms and Dijkstra's Algorithm  

To compile and run sorting algorithms...  
`cd ./sorting`   
`make`  
`sort`  

To compile and run Dijkstra's algorithm...  
`cd ./dijkstra`  
`make`  
`dijkstra`  

*Note*  
These programs must be run on Linux, and local computer must have OpenGL directories installed.  

*Controls for Dijkstra's Algorithm*  
Right-click on grid to set start point. Right-click again to set end point.   
Left-click to create walls. Hold left-click to draw lines of walls.  
Press 'D' to run Dijkstra's Algorithm! Press 'R' to reset points. Press 'P' to toggle path. 

Globals variables for customizing window size, grid size, and animation speed can be found and modified  
in "globals.h"


*Controls for Sorting Algorithms*  
Press R to randomize the numbers. For different sorting animations, press...  
B - Bubble sort  
M - Merge sort  
H - Heap sort  
Q - Quick sort  
X - Radix sort
Press E to terminate the program.  

Global variables for customizing window size, number of elements, animation speed, and animation style can  
be found and modified in "globals.h"
